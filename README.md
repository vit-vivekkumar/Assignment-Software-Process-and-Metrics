Software Measurements Tool: O3SMEASURES
The O3SMEASURES Plug-in for Eclipse to measure software internal quality. It was developed as part
of my dissertation entitled "A Quantitative Study to Characterize the Internal Quality of Open-Source
Object-Oriented Software Systems"
O3SMEASURES is a measure-based tool to evaluating software quality using different sourcecode properties. The tool provides information on software artifacts using the 15 measures most
cited in empirical studies to investigate internal quality of software in the last decade + 11
support measures such as Number of Lambdas, Number of Method References, etc. It was
developed as part of my dissertation entitled " A Quantitative Study to Characterize the Internal
Quality of Open-Source Object-Oriented Software Systems". o3smeasures-tool has a low active
ecosystem.It has a neutral sentiment in the developer community.
o3smeasures can be used as an Eclipse Application, importing the project into your workspace.
After import the o3smeasures project, with the right mouse button you need select the
option Run as -> Eclipse Application. In the runtime eclipse application, select a Java project
to be measured and with the right mouse button, go to O3SMeasures -> Analyze Java project.
We analyzed MakeChat - App Software by using the o3smeasurement tool.
The analysis of MakeChat - App Software consists of the following:
O3SMEASURES main measure’s overview
It contains the main measures of the software as follows:
Number Of Classes
Lines Of Code
Number Of Methods
Number Of Attributes
Cyclomatic Complexity
Weight Methods Per Class
Depth Of Inheritance Tree
Number Of Children
Coupling Between Objects
Response For Class
Lack Of Cohesion Methods
Tight Class Cohesion
O3SMEASURES main measure’s diagnostic view:
O3SMEASURES Secondary measure’s diagnostic view:
O3SMEASURES FACTORS VIEW:
It is a measure values vs factors bar graph of increase in modularity, complexity reduction and
tight loose class cohesion.
O3SMEASURES PIE CHART VIEW
It is a pie chart of main measures of the project which provides the idea of the numeric proportion of the
measures. It uses pie slices to show the size of data.
O3SMEASURES INDIACTORS VIEW
It contains the graph plotted between main measures with respect to measures std deviation and
factors weights. Different types of symbols used for various main measures as shown
O3SMEASURES INDIVIDUAL FOLDERS LOC’S
It gives the different lines of code (LOC) for the different folders available in the MAKE CHAT
APP SOFTWARE. The different LOC measured in the tool are given as fallows
• LOC
• SLOC PHYSICAL
• SLOC LOGICAL
• MVG
• BLOC
• C&SLOC
• CLOC
• CWORD
• HCLOC
• HCWORD
O3SMEASURES INDIVIDUAL FILE LOC’S
It gives individual files loc as shown
